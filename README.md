# JavaFX Pie Chart Generator Based on Probability

This application reads alphabet letters in a text file and stores the letters and the number of occurrences of those letters in a collection in descending order. Then given the number of events, the application generates a pie chart to demonstrate the probabilities of the selected many events. Here an event refers to retrieving a letter 'x' (x is an alphabetic character) from the text file. Events are selected in the descending order of probability.
